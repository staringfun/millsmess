## Mills Mess â€” Not Just a Name

The name Mills Mess comes from a famous juggling pattern that appears chaotic but is built on a precise and elegant structure. This reflects our architecture: a scalable, event-driven, session-based backend that juggles complex event flows, service interactions, and session state â€” all with rhythm, coordination, and clarity beneath the surface.

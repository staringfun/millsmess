## Overview

The Client Interface subdomain is responsible for exposing the platformâ€™s capabilities to external developers and applications through standardized client libraries (SDKs) and APIs.
It abstracts the complexity of the underlying services (authentication, real-time communication, game session management) and provides simple, unified APIs tailored to specific platforms (e.g., web).

These client libraries enable fast and reliable integration, handling low-level details like authentication flows, connection management, event handling, and error recovery.
This subdomain plays a critical role in developer experience and adoption of the Mills Mess Engine.

## Overview

The Client service is the outward-facing integration layer of the platform.
It provides and maintains SDKs (Software Development Kits) for supported platforms such as JavaScript, iOS, Android, or Unity, offering a consistent and simplified developer experience.
These SDKs encapsulate common workflows—authentication, session management, real-time messaging—so that application developers can focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure or protocol-level details.

The service acts as a wrapper around other internal subdomains (like Real-Time Comms or Identity & Analytics), abstracting low-level mechanics such as token exchange, WebSocket initialization, and error handling.
It may also manage versioning, platform-specific behaviors, and compatibility with the broader engine.

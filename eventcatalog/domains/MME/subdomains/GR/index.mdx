## Overview

The Game Runtime subdomain is the heart of gameplay logic.
Itâ€™s responsible for creating, running, and terminating game sessions.
Each session has its own state, participants, and game rules.
Depending on the product, this could also handle media streams (e.g., WebRTC) and server-authoritative decisions.
It ensures synchronization between players and works closely with Real-Time Comms to distribute live updates.

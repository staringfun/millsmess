## Overview

The media-engine service is the authoritative backend for executing and maintaining live multiplayer sessions.
It handles the full lifecycle of a game session: from creation and user participation to state management and teardown.
Each game session is managed as a distinct runtime instance, capable of processing user actions, enforcing game rules, and broadcasting state updates in real time.

In addition to game logic, the service supports real-time media features such as WebRTC signaling for audio/video or data channels, where applicable.
It ensures deterministic behavior, consistency across clients, and tight integration with other services (such as Real-Time Comms for broadcasting and Identity for user validation).

The media-engine is typically designed to be low-latency and horizontally scalable, allowing for concurrent execution of multiple isolated game sessions.

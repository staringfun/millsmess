## Overview

The socket service is the core transport layer of the Real-Time Comms subdomain.
It establishes and maintains persistent WebSocket connections between clients and the backend, allowing for fast and efficient exchange of messages and events.

Once connected, clients can subscribe to session updates, send gameplay events, receive broadcasts, and track user presence in real time.
The socket service ensures message delivery, enforces channel/session boundaries, and handles connection reliability through features like reconnection, authentication, and message buffering.

This service also plays a key role in pub/sub messaging, routing events between clients and other backend services (like the game session engine), and supporting presence indicators such as online/offline status or typing indicators.

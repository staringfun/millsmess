### Overview

The WebSocket channel is a global, bidirectional communication layer that operates over a single persistent WebSocket connection per client.
Rather than segmenting communication into multiple pub/sub channels, all real-time traffic—such as game events, session updates, and presence information—is multiplexed over this one shared channel.

The channel is secured via authentication tokens and handles message delivery, connection lifecycle, and protocol-level features like ping/pong, reconnection, and error reporting.

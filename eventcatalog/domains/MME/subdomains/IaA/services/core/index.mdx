## Overview

The core service is the foundational component of the Identity & Analytics subdomain.
It is responsible for user identity, including registration, authentication, and profile management.
It also issues and validates session tokens that are used across all other services in the platform.

In addition to identity management, the core service is responsible for collecting, storing, and exposing usage analytics.
This includes tracking user behavior, session participation, and system-level metrics that support monitoring, reporting, and optimization.

By owning both identity and analytics, the core service ensures that each user's actions can be securely authenticated and meaningfully analyzed.
It provides a single source of truth for user data and a reliable stream of insights into platform usage.

## Overview

The Mills Mess Engine is the core system behind a real-time, session-based multiplayer experience.
It provides a modular backend that enables clients to authenticate, connect via WebSockets, participate in live game sessions, and exchange real-time events.
The architecture is divided into well-defined subdomains to promote clear responsibility boundaries and allow each component to scale independently.
Mills Mess is designed for performance, low latency, and high availability.
